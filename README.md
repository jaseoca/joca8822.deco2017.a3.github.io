This is a very simplified version of the initial mockup with a more bare-bones functionality. The user form was kept intact and has the same variables but has been turned into a collapsable to be more seamless in a single-page front-end architecture.


I was also initially deciding on whether to use a Spotify API or rely on manual input in my mockup, a critique that was given to me was that this was unclear in my data model. For this prototype, it is entirely manual input.


Aesthetically, it remains quite similar with a mainly basic and contrasty black/white theme with a dark blue to red gradient for the 'add listing' tab. A lot of the UI however was simplified. For example, the profile section and signout buttons have been removed due to no need for user authentication. Most of the sort-by functions have not been implemented either.


So in total, the data model properties that did not make it into the mockup include year, genre category, and image.
In hindsight, this was more of an organisational and time management problem.


Also with the UI, I kept the cards but changed the internal layout. It is entirely text-based whereas the mockup was mostly image based. This was due to not using the API. The app allows users to input basic song data and have it displayed in the form of a card. Other functionalities only enable adding more listings or removing current listings.

What I used AI for:
- Syntax: Proofreading my code for errors I may of missed. 
- Variables: I was also having problems with being able to display all of my variables in a listing and used it to help with a solution with my script. 
- Cards: I needed help with a solution on how to input my variables into a card and how to make them work with flexbox. 
- Helping find a solution to enabling local storage when using the app.
